A log showing what was changed between each fmincon iteration

00000: local minimum, no GRF constraints
00001: used 00000 as guess, lift off vel positive con, z-l=0 at the two surfaces constraint, no GRF, local min found
00002: used 00001 as guess, added vel matching constraint at the switching surfaces, infesible
00003: used 00001 as guess, chaned vel con at switching surface, prematurely stopped
00004: used 00003 as guess, converged
00005: used 00004 as the guess, added another vel con on l, local min found looks good (optimized fully without GRF)
00006: used 00005 as the guess, added GRF, grf = inv(J*Minv*J.')*(J*Minv*(-CG +pogo.F));converged to infesible point
00007: used 00005 as the guess, removed the lift off vel positive con, infesible
00008: used 00005 as the guess, changed tol, local min possible
00009: used 00008 as the guess, changed the tol back, infesible
00010: used 00009 as the guess,infesible
00011: used 00009 as the guess, changed the min length of l, infesible
00012: used 00009 as the guess, changed the min length of l, local min found that satisfies the constraints






























OLD RESULTS  %results

00000: used my original guess, stopped prematurely
00001: used the output of 00000 as the guess, stopped at infesible point
00002: lmited dq and the force. use 00000 as the guess, loops combined for fligh, stoped prematurely
00003: same as above, chnged mass 1. infesible point

changed mass back to 10 kg
00004: used 00002 as the guess, solver stopped prematurely
00005: used 00004 as the guess, solver stopped prematurely
00006: used 00005 as the guess, solver stopped prematurely

REMOVED THE LINEAR CONSTRAINTS
00007: used 00005 as the guess, removed the linear constraints, stopped prematurely

CHANGED THE SPRING CONSTANT, STILL NO LINEAR CON
00008: used 00007 as the guess, no lin con, weaker spring, solver stopped prematurely

CHANGED THE GRF CALCULATION ((J*Minv*J.')*(J*Minv*(-CG +pogo.F -pogo.k*(q-pogo.lrest)));), added liftoff velocity constraint, changed mass 2=mass 1
00009: used 00008 as the guess, solver stopped prematurely
00010: used 00009 as the guess, solver stopped prematurely

CHANGED THE GRF AGAIN (inv(J*Minv*J.')*(-J*Minv*(-CG +pogo.F));), changed the tolerances 
00011: used 00010 as the guess, infesible

CHANGED THE GRF AGAIN  ((J*Minv*J.')*(-J*Minv*(-CG +pogo.F));), changed the tolerances again
00012: used 00010 as the guess, stopped prematurely

CHANGED THE APPLIED FORCE FOR THE AERIAL STAGE
00013: used 00007 as the guess, stopped prematurely

CHANGED THE APPLIED FORCE BACK (0,-F), CHANGED MASS 1 BACK, changed the spring back
00014: used 00012 as the guess, stopped prematurely

REMOVED THE GRF STUFF
00015: used 00012 as the guess, worked much better, solver stopped prematurely

REMOVED THE A FOR q+ which i did wrong!!
00016: used 00015 as the guess, stopped prematurely

CHANGED SPRING CONSTANT FROM 0.5 to 5
00017: used 00016 as guess, stopped prematurely

removed force for aerial phase
00018: used 00016 as guess, 

PUT THE FORCE BACK, changed the spring constant again, removed all constraints excet temp1, defects, start, stop
00019: used 00016 as the guess, solver stopped prematurely

ADDED TWO DEFECT CONSTRAINTS AT THE SWITCHING SURFACE, the constraint was on l
00020: used 00019 as the guess, stopped prematurely
00021: used 00020 as the guess, looks good but stopped prematurely
00022: used 00021 as the guess, looks even better!!!!
00023: used 00022 as the guess, local min possible
